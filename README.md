# FOLR2⁺ macrophage niches connect TLS IgA remodeling with anti–PD-1 efficacy in advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma

## Introduction

In this repository, you could access to the code used to analysis the scRNA-seq ,Stereo-seq ,Stereo-CITE data from the associated manuscript.

Analysis:Stereo-seq ,Stereo-CITE data analysis scripts
1) The scripts under the [Pathological_regions](https://github.com/Renji-RCC/RCC/tree/main/Analysis/Pathological_regions) directory are used for extracting pathological regions.
2) The scripts under the [TLS_shells](https://github.com/Renji-RCC/RCC/tree/main/Analysis/TLS_shells) directory are used for generating concentric shells extending outward from the TLS core.
3) The scripts under the [boundary_expansion](https://github.com/Renji-RCC/RCC/tree/main/Analysis/boundary_expansion) directory perform boundary-centered expansion with fixed intervals.

## Data access
